Install
======

You need to install it first, so let's install it.

I couldn't install it with pip in the past, so I had to install it manually, which was a lot of work, but now I have cszp on pypi, so the installation is very easy.

warning: This program is for Linux (Debian system). Note that it may not work with operating systems other than RedHat's.

## 1.Install libraries required for installation

hint: This time we will use pip (external library management system for the python language), so if you don't have pip installed, install it using the command below. ```Sudo apt install python-pip```

Installation can only be done with the following command! It's so easy!

```
pip install -U pip
pip install cszp
```

The installation is complete like this. What? You may think so, but you should see a command called cszp. It is OK if it can be executed!

If not, check for errors and try again.

Next, I will explain the basic usage of cszp!
